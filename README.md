This GitHub repository contains a usable axolotl model that stands upright, with floating arms and legs (like Rayman).

I will try to provide updates to the models as soon as possible.

Here is a set of rules I ask you to follow to respect my work :D  :

- PLEASE DO NOT SELL THIS MODEL 

- The best way to show appreciation is to credit me when you use this template <3

- Please do not fully claim the model as your own.

Thanks !! :D
